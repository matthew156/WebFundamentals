    <h2>Job History</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Produce Clerk:</strong> I worked as a produce clerk after working
      in customer service. This job contained the same principles about how one
      should treat the customers, except there was a lot more attention to image
      to the overall department. This taught me maintaining a good image for the
      department ultimately played a role in providing premier customer service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Server:</strong> Being a server allowed me to interact more
      personally with the customers than being a produce clerk ever did. The
      biggest struggle that came with being a server is making sure everything
      can go smoothly with the customers orders with everything behind the
      scenes
